# House Price Prediction Project

House Price Prediction Project is aimed at developing a predictive model for house prices using Google Colab, Python, HTML, CSS, and Flask.

## Overview

The project focuses on developing a predictive model for house prices based on a dataset of Bangalore houses. It includes feature engineering, data extraction, and cleaning to ensure data quality and improve model accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Google Colab**: For model training and selection in a collaborative environment.
- **Python**: Used for data preprocessing, model development, and Flask application.
- **HTML, CSS**: Frontend development for creating a user-friendly web application interface.
- **Flask**: Backend framework for integrating the predictive model and serving predictions.

## Features

- **Predictive Model Development**: Developed models using Linear Regression and Ensemble Techniques to predict house prices effectively.
- **Web Application**: Created a user-friendly web application where users can input house details and get real-time predictions using the trained model.
- **Integration**: Integrated a pickled model with Flask to handle user inputs and provide predictions seamlessly.
